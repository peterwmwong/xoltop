Come talk to me, I don't bite.

Developing
----------
[make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) - Ant and Maven would be overkill

[node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) - to run CoffeeScript and Stylus compiler

### Useful tools
[vim](http://www.vim.org/)

[vim-stylus](https://github.com/wavded/vim-stylus)

[vim-coffee-script](https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script)
